# Types of Test Doubles

- **Dummy:** It is used as a *placeholder* when an argument needs to be filled in.
- **Stub:** It provides fake data to the SUT (System Under Test).
- **Spy**: It records information about how the class is being used.
- **Mock:** It defines an expectation of how it will be used. It will cause a failure if the expectation isnâ€™t met.
- **Fake:** It is an actual implementation of the contract but is unsuitable for production.
